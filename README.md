The webpage is the result of the groups joint effort to leverage our skills in Python, Javascript, HTML and CSS to create a functional and interactive dashboard. The dashboard provides three visuals that are each tied to the leaflet map. 

The Leaflet Map:
The map breaks down the state of New York by county and uses a tooltip to display that county's obesity rate. It also includes a color scale that darkens as the level of obesity increases.

Line Chart:
The line chart is directly binded to the users selection of each county on the map. When the user selects a county, the line chart will automatically populate the median income level for that county by race over multiple years. This chart has the functionality to also deselect or reselect specific races.

Pie Chart:
The pie chart has the same binded functionality as the line chart, but it is used to represent the overall diversity of each county. It shows the percentage of each race that makes up that population.

This excercise required a great deal of collaboration to allow each visualization to work together. This is something that could be built on for more specific use in the future.
